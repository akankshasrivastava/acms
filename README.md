# Adaptive Context Management System (ACMS)

An intelligent context management system designed to optimize how Large Language Models handle and process information during extended interactions. This system dynamically manages context windows, implementing smart pruning and retrieval mechanisms while maintaining performance at scale.

## Key Features

- Dynamic context window management with intelligent pruning
- Two-tier memory system (short-term buffer + long-term store)
- Attention-based importance scoring for context retention
- Performance-optimized retrieval system
- Comprehensive benchmarking suite

## Technical Overview

The system implements novel approaches to context management through:
- Smart token importance scoring using attention patterns
- Efficient memory utilization via adaptive compression
- Dynamic context window sizing based on content relevance
- Optimized retrieval mechanisms for historical context
